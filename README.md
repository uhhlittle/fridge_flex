Fridge Flex

For my third project for WDI I intend to build a personal fridge app that allows a user to save recipes that call for the ingredients in their fridge.
Based on the recipes saved for the user, the app will also generate a grocery list with ingredients for each recipe, minus the ingredients not in the fridge.

User can create login, edit profile to include name, location, etc
User can add ingredients to fridge.
User can remove ingredients from the fridge
User can see current list of ingredients in fridge 
User can select ingredients from the fridge and return an api search
User can favorite recipes from api return.
User can view profile page to see favorite recipes and current grocery list
User can remove favorites from their profile page
